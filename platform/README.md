# platform

This module does not contain any source code â€“ it simply defines a "platform" that consumers can
depend upon to avoid having to specify version numbers for every individual workflow library they
use.

See [the Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) for more information.
